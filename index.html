        <h2>World Architecture History</h2>
        <div class="history">
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/FRKhan.jpg"
                alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/FRKhan.jpg">
            <p>Fazlur Rahman Khan (Bengali: ফজলুর রহমান খান, Fozlur Rôhman Khan; 3 April 1929 – 27 March 1982) was a
                Bangladeshi-American[3] structural engineer and architect, who initiated important structural systems
                for
                skyscrapers.[4][5][6] Considered the "father of tubular designs" for high-rises,[7] Khan was also a
                pioneer
                in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the
                tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center.

                A partner in the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago, Khan, more than any other individual,
                ushered
                in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century.[8][9] He has
                been
                called the "Einstein of structural engineering" and the "Greatest Structural Engineer of the 20th
                Century"
                for his innovative use of structural systems that remain fundamental to modern skyscraper design and
                construction.[4][10] In his honor, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat established the
                Fazlur
                Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal, as one of their CTBUH Skyscraper Awards.

                Although best known for skyscrapers, Khan was also an active designer of other kinds of structures,
                including the Hajj airport terminal, the McMath–Pierce solar telescope and several stadium
                structures.[11][12]

                Family and background
                Fazlur Rahman Khan was born on 3 April 1929 to a Bengali Muslim family in Dacca, Bengal Presidency
                (present-day Bangladesh).[13] He was from and brought up in the Khan Bari of Bhandarikandi in Madaripur,
                Faridpur District. His father, Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Khan, was a high school mathematics teacher and
                textbook author who eventually became the Director of Public Instruction in Bengal and after retirement
                served as the first Principal of Jagannath College.[13] His mother, Khadijah Khatun, was the daughter of
                Abdul Basit Chowdhury, the Zamindar (aristocratic landowner) of Dulai in Pabna who traced his ancestry
                to a
                migrant from Samarkand in Turkestan.[1] Khan's paternal uncle, Abdul Hakim Khan, was the son-in-law of
                Syed
                Abdul Jabbar, a zamindar based in Comilla.[14]

                Early life and education
                Khan attended Armanitola Government High School, in Dhaka. After that, he studied Civil Engineering in
                Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur (present day Indian Institute of Engineering Science
                and
                Technology, Shibpur), Kolkata, India, and then received his Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from
                Ahsanullah Engineering College, (now Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology). He received a
                Fulbright Scholarship and a government scholarship, which enabled him to travel to the United States in
                1952. There he studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. In three years Khan earned two
                master's degrees – one in structural engineering and one in theoretical and applied mechanics – and a
                PhD in
                structural engineering[15] with thesis titled Analytical Study of Relations Among Various Design
                Criteria
                for Rectangular Prestressed Concrete Beams.[16]

                His hometown in Dhaka did not have any buildings taller than three stories. He did not view his first
                skyscraper in person until the age of 21 years old, and he had not stepped inside a mid-rise building
                until
                he moved to the United States for graduate school. Despite this, the environment of his hometown in
                Dhaka
                later influenced his tube building concept, which was inspired by the bamboo that sprouted around Dhaka.
                He
                found that a hollow tube, like the bamboo in Dhaka, lent a high-rise vertical durability.[17]

                Career

                A sculpture honoring Fazlur Khan at the Willis Tower
                In 1955, employed by the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), he began working in
                Chicago.
                He was made a partner in 1966. He worked the rest of his life side by side with fellow architect Bruce
                Graham.[18] Khan introduced design methods and concepts for efficient use of material in building
                architecture. His first building to employ the tube structure was the Chestnut De-Witt apartment
                building.[19] During the 1960s and 1970s, he became noted for his designs for Chicago's 100-story John
                Hancock Center and 110-story Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world
                from
                1973 until 1998.

                He believed that engineers needed a broader perspective on life, saying, "The technical man must not be
                lost
                in his own technology; he must be able to appreciate life, and life is art, drama, music, and most
                importantly, people."[13]

                Khan's personal papers, most of which were in his office at the time of his death, are held by the
                Ryerson &
                Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Fazlur Khan Collection includes manuscripts,
                sketches, audio cassette tapes, slides and other materials regarding his work.

                Personal life
                For enjoyment, Khan loved singing Rabindranath Tagore's poetic songs in Bengali. He and his wife,
                Liselotte,
                who immigrated from Austria, had one daughter who was born in 1960.[20] In 1967, he elected to become a
                United States citizen.[21]</p>
